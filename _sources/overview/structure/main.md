<!--proselint ignore misc.annotations-->
TODO

```{attention}
Every chapter will have 4 parts:

- A tutorial: you will be walked through solving a problem. You will be
  specifically told what to do and what to expect.
- A how to section: this will be a shorter more succinct section that will
  detail how to carry out specific things.
- A further information section: this will be a section with references to
  further resources as well as background information about specific things in
  the chapter and answers to common questions.
- An exercise section: this will be a number of exercises that you can work on.
```
